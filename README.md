  ## Description

  This application is designed to generate a readme file in order to save time from having to fill out a full readme from scratch. The user answers a few prompts about whichever project the readme file is intended for. The application fills out the remainder of the readme file including title, section headings, filler text, and a table of contents with working links. Then, the actual README file is generated, in "markdown" format (README.md).

  ## Installation

  After installing the program, be sure to install inquirer and run "npm install -y" in the command line to install all required packages for the program to function correctly.

  ## Usage

  In the command line, run "node index.js" to initialize the applicaiton. You will be asked a series of questions for you to answer, in order to fill out the readme that will be generated. These prompts include a title for your project, a desctiption, how to use it, etc... When prompted for your github, be sure to include the full URL.
